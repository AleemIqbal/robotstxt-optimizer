== Description ==

The "Advanced Robots.txt Optimizer & Editor" is a WordPress plugin that enhances the functionality of the Robots.txt file on your website by allowing you to edit, optimize, and customize the Robots.txt file to fit your website's specific needs. The plugin provides various features and options to customize the Robots.txt file to improve website SEO, protect website resources, and manage website traffic by blocking search engines and web crawlers from accessing specific areas of your website.

The plugin provides a feature to add the default WordPress Robots.txt rules to the Robots.txt file. This feature blocks search engines and web crawlers from accessing the WordPress administration panel, which protects the backend of your website. This feature allows the crawling of the admin-ajax.php file for AJAX requests to the server, which allows dynamic functionality.

It also provides options to prevent the crawling of the WordPress JSON API endpoints and search URLs, such as "/search/" and "/?s=".

The plugin also provides options to block feed directories, spam directories, and WayBackMachine crawler to save crawl budget, improve website security, and protect website resources. The plugin also allows website owners to block ChatGPT from using website content.

The plugin provides options to optimize your WooCommerce website by blocking the Cart, Checkout, My Account, and Login pages from indexation, as well as blocking WooCommerce parameters to avoid duplicate content issues.

Finally, the plugin provides an option to add sitemap links to the Robots.txt file, which allows search engines to quickly and efficiently crawl the site and index its content, improving search engine rankings and visibility. The plugin provides options to add Yoast Sitemap Link, News Sitemap Link, and WooCommerce Product Sitemap Link to the Robots.txt file.

The plugin also provides an option to block SEO tool crawlers, such as Ahrefs, Semrush, Majestic, and others, from accessing your website, which improves website security, privacy, and protects website resources.
